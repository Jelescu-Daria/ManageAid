This repository constitutes the Java Spring Boot backend of the application created as part of my bachelor thesis at Babe»ô-Bolyai University, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, presented in the July 2024 session.

## Description of the application 
ManageAid is a web application that provides various organizational services for
micro-businesses: appointments/schedules, membership availability of customers,
payments made by customers, business expenses, and many others. ManageAid
caters to micro-businesses by providing a framework to conduct necessary business
activities in a scaled-down way. With tools useful in day-to-day operations, it is
meant to have the ease of use and personal touch of a physical agenda.
<br>
The application is modular. The user can choose what services they want or
do not want to use. The chosen modules appear in a dashboard, the main page of
the application. The modules available for each type of user - admin, employee or
customer - differ and cater to their specific needs.
